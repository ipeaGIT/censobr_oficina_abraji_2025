Transportation equity concerns are fundamentally related to two types of issues: (1) accessibility inequality and (2) accessibility poverty. **In this section you will learn how to use the `{accessibility}` package to calculate different indicators of accessibility inequality and poverty.**\n<img align=\"right\" src=\"/images/accessibility_logo.png?raw=true\" alt=\"logo\" width=\"140\">\n\nIn a recent paper, we discussed the advantages and disadvantages of various inequality and poverty metrics most commonly used in the transport literature [@karner2024advances] - ungated PDF [here](https://www.urbandemographics.org/publication/2024_transp_measuring_transportation_equity/). The slides below give a *very* short summary of some ideas discussed in the paper. Just enough to follow this workshop section. Nonetheless, I would strongly recommend reading the whole paper.\n\n \n<!-- Slides -->\n<p><embed src=\"slides/3.3_equity_metrics.pdf\" style=\"width:100.0%;height:100vh;\" /></p>\n\n\nIn this section, we'll be using a couple sample data sets for the city of Belo Horizonte (Brazil), which come with the `{accessibility}` package. In the code chunk below, we read the travel time matrix and land use data, and calculate the average number of jobs accessible in 30 by public transport.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# path to data\n22 \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 22\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n",
