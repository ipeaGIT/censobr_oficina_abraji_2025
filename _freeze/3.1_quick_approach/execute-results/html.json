In the next section, we'll see a more flexible and robust way to do the same thing. Here we'll be calculating the number of schools accessible by public transport within a travel time of 20 minutes.\n\n\n### 1. Allocating memory to Java & loading packages\n\nFirst, let's increase the memory available to run Java, which is used by the underlying R5 routing engine. To increase the available memory to 2 GB, for example, we use the following command. Note that this needs to be run ***before*** loading the packages that will be used in our analysis.\n \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n library(dplyr)\n library(ggplot2)\n```\n:::\n",
